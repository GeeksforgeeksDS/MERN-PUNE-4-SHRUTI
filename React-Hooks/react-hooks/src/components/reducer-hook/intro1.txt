The reducer function
The JavaScript reduce() method executes a reducer function on each element of the array and returns a single value. 
The reduce() method accepts a reducer function, which itself can accept up to four arguments. The code snippet below illustrates how a reducer works:

const reducer = (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue;

[2, 4, 6, 8].reduce(reducer)


const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

function reducer(state, action) { }

dispatch({ type: 'increment/decrement' })

# When not to use the useReducer Hook ::

1. When your application needs a single source of truth
2. When you want a more predictable state
3. When state-lifting to the top-level component no longer suffices
4. When you need to persist state even after a page refresh
