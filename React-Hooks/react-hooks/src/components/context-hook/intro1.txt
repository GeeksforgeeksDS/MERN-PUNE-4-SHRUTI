When do you need context?
The main idea of using the context is to allow your components to access global data and re-render when that global data is changed. 
Context solves the props drilling problem: when you have to pass down props from parents to children.

You can hold inside the context:

global state
theme
application configuration
authenticated user name
user settings
preferred language
a collection of services

Note: using the useContext() in every consumer â€” increases complexity.
