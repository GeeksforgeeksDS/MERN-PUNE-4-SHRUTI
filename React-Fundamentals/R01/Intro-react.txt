#MVC

#MVC with MERN :-
MERN Stack is a JavaScript Stack short for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js

1. Model:

-In the Model layer, databases play a critical role. 
-MongoDB is a popular choice due to its flexibility and scalability. 
-When integrated with Mongoose, a JavaScript framework, developers can define data models 
and interact with MongoDB in a structured manner.

2. View:

-React serves as the front-end part of the MVC setup, efficiently rendering components. 
-Templating languages such as EJS and handlebars can be used with Node.js and Express.

3. Controller:

-The Controller, often powered by Node.js and Express.js, handles application logic efficiently.
-Express simplifies routing and HTTP requests, while Node.js, with its non-blocking, 
event-driven architecture, manages real-time and data-intensive applications.
