#ReactJS Virtual DOM

React JS Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the DOM. DOM refers to the Document Object Model that represents the 
content of XML or HTML documents as a tree structure so that the programs can be read, accessed and changed in the document structure, style, and content.

#DOM : 
DOM stands for ‘Document Object Model’.
DOM is represented as a tree data structure. It contains a node for each UI element present in the web document.
Allows web developers to modify content through JavaScript

#Disadvantages of real DOM :
Every time the DOM gets updated, the updated element and its children have to be rendered again to update the UI of our page.
Recalculating the CSS and changing the layouts involves complex algorithms, and they do affect the performance.

#Virtual DOM
React uses Virtual DOM exists which is like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM(a virtual representation of the DOM)
So each time there is a change in the state of our application, the virtual DOM gets updated first instead of the real DOM.
