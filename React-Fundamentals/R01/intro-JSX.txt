#What is JSX ?
.JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX is basically a syntax extension of JavaScript.
.React JSX helps us to write HTML in JavaScript and forms the basis of React Development.
.JSX creates an element in React that gets rendered in the UI. 
.It is transformed into JavaScript functions by the compiler at runtime.


#Why JSX ?
.It is faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript.
.It makes it easier for us to create templates.
.Instead of separating the markup and logic in separate files, React uses components for this purpose.
.As JSX is an expression, we can use it inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, 
accept it as arguments, or return it from functions.

const example = "JSX"
const ele = <div>This component uses {example} </div>


#Attributes in JSX ?
JSX allows us to use attributes with the HTML elements just like we do with normal HTML. 
JSX uses the camelcase convention for attributes
    -The change of class attribute to className
    -Creation of custom attributes: prefixed by data-* attribute



#Rules to Write JSX 

Always return a single Root Element
