A component's lifecycle has four main phases: 
the Mounting Phase, the Updating Phase, the Unmounting Phase and Error Handling Phase

1. Component Mounting Phase :
The mounting phase refers to the period when a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.

mounting phase has four main lifecycle methods :

    a. constructor()  : The constructor() method is called when the component is first created. 
                        You use it to initialize the component's state and bind methods to the component's instance.
    
    b. render()  :  render() method is responsible for generating the component's virtual DOM representation based on 
                    its current props and state. It is called every time the component needs to be re-rendered, either 
                    because its props or state have changed, or because a parent component has been re-rendered.

    c. getDerivedStateFromProps() : getDerivedStateFromProps() is a lifecycle method available in React 16.3 and later versions
                                    that is invoked during the mounting and updating phase of a component.
                                    During the mounting phase, getDerivedStateFromProps() is called after the constructor and before render().
                                    eg::: static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)

    d. componentDidMount() :    componentDidMount() method is called once the component has been mounted into the DOM. It is typically 
                                used to set up any necessary event listeners or timers, perform any necessary API calls or data fetching,
                                and perform other initialization tasks that require access to the browser's DOM API.

2. Component Updating Phase :
This phase occurs when a component's props or state changes, and the component needs to be updated in the DOM.

updating phase has five main lifecycle methods :

    a. getDerivedStateFromProps() : same as above 

    b. render() : same as above 

    c. shouldComponentUpdate() :    shouldComponentUpdate()  method is called before a component is updated. It takes two arguments: 
                                    nextProps and nextState. This method returns a boolean value that determines whether the component 
                                    should update or not. If this method returns true, the component will update, and if it returns false, the component will not update.
    
    d. componentWillUpdate() :  componentWillUpdate() is a lifecycle method in React that gets called just before a component's update cycle starts. 
                                It receives the next prop and state as arguments and allows you to perform any necessary actions before the component updates.
                                But this method is not recommended for updating the state, as it can cause an infinite loop of rendering. It is primarily used 
                                for tasks such as making API calls, updating the DOM, or preparing the component to receive new data. 

    e. componentDidUpdate() :   componentDidUpdate() method is a lifecycle method in React that is called after a component has been updated and re-rendered. 
                                It is useful for performing side effects or additional operations when the component's props or state have changed.

    f. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() :  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method is called just before the component's UI is updated. It allows the component to capture some 
                                    information about the current state of the UI, such as the scroll position before it changes.

3. Component Unmounting Phase :
The unmounting phase refers to the lifecycle stage when a component is being removed from the DOM (Document Object Model) and is no longer rendered or accessible.

unmounting phase has one main lifecycle method :

    a. componentWillUnmount() : This method is called just before the component is removed from the DOM. It allows you to perform any necessary 
                                cleanup, such as canceling timers, removing event listeners, or clearing any data structures that were set up during the mounting phase.
                                After componentWillUnmount() is called, the component is removed from the DOM and all of its state and props are destroyed.

4. Error handling Phase : 
When there is an error during rendering in lifecycle methods or in the constructor of any child component.

error handling phase has two main lifecycle methods :

    a. getDerivedStateFromError() 
    b. componentDidCatch()
