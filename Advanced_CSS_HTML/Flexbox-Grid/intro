The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module aims at providing a more efficient way
to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, 
even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).

Main motive - mostly to accommodate the container to all kind of display devices and screen sizes

Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.
